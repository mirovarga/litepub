# Overview

LitePub is a static blog generator that tries to be as easy to use as possible.

It requires no software dependencies, needs no configuration files, uses no
databases. All it needs is one binary, posts written in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and a set of templates to
render the posts to static HTML files.

Posts don't have to include any special metadata (aka front matter) like title
or date in them - the title, date and optional tags are parsed from
the natural flow of the posts.
